## Quick Example

```js
import Sapliy from "@sapliyio/fintech";

const sapliy = new Sapliy("sk_test_xxx");

// Emit an event
await sapliy.events.emit("checkout.completed", {
  orderId: "order_123",
  amount: 9900,
  currency: "USD",
});

// This event can trigger flows in the visual builder!
```

## Architecture

```
Organization → Zone → Event → Flow → Action
```

| Concept          | Purpose                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Organization** | Owns everything, has users/teams/policies      |
| **Zone**         | Isolated automation space with test/live modes |
| **Event**        | The universal trigger (SDK, UI, providers)     |
| **Flow**         | Automation logic connecting events to actions  |
